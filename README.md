Intermediate Scale Runs
========================

ISM = Intermeidate Scale Model

R1: ISM + No Subgrid Flow + SEB (2-component: bare-ground, snow-covered) + No Deformation

R2: ISM + No Subgrid Flow + SEB (2-component: bare-ground, snow-covered) + Deformation

R3: ISM + Static Subgrid Flow + SEB (3-component : bare-ground, snow-covered, frozen-water) + No Deformation 

R4: ISM + Static Subgrid Flow + SEB (3-component : bare-ground, snow-covered, frozen-water) + Deformation 

R5: ISM + Dynamic Subgrid Flow + SEB (3-component : bare-ground, snow-covered, frozen-water) + No Deformation 

R6: ISM + Dynamic Subgrid Flow + SEB (3-component : bare-ground, snow-covered, frozen-water) + Deformation 


Note:
Subgrid flow model will alwats use 3-component seb

Notation:
_A : Manning's coefficient = 100
